            <p><h1>LINGAYEN, Philippines - The Provincial Government of Pangasinan, led by Governor Amado "Pogi" I. Espino III, celebrated the 442nd founding anniversary of the province of Pangasinan and officially opened the 13th Pangasinan Tourism and Trade Expo at the Capitol Beachfront on April 5, 2022.</p></h1>
<br>

<p><h1>With the word "asin" at the heart of its name, the province of Pangasinan is known to be one of the top producers of salt in the Philippines. This significant commodity embodies the identity of Pangasinan and Pangasinenses as Archbishop Socrates B. Villegas of the Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan emphasized in his homily during the Misa na Pisasalamat held at the historical Sison Auditorium in Lingayen.

<p><h1>"Our forefathers preserved Pangasinan by the salt of sacrifices," Archbishop Villegas shared. "Salt is a component of contracts, of promises, and of word of honor. Our forefathers exchanged salt in agreement. This is because salt is constant. Salt does not change.</p></h1>

Bataoil, Board Members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Provincial Government department heads and employees, and local tourism officers as they took part in a parade led by the University of Luzon Drum and Bugle Corps en route to the Capitol Beachfront where Fr.
